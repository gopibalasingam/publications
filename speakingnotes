For those I haven’t met yet, I’m Gopi Balasingam, Chief Architect for Canada Segment. Now, Corina just shared that she’s a twin- tough fun fact to beat! I don’t have a twin, but I do have three teenagers in high school, which means my house is basically a live experiment in chaos theory. If you ever need advice on surviving group projects, last-minute science fairs, or negotiating screen time, I’m your person. Much like my household, today’s agenda is all about moving from creative chaos to real results. We’ll sketch big ideas, pressure-test strategies, and if we’re lucky leave with more clarity than my kids have about whose turn it is to do the dishes. 

We have a packed agenda with a great mix of insights and interactive sessions.
This morning, we’ll start with an external perspective – a fireside chat that will give us fresh eyes on our strategy from outside our organization.
Then, we’ll dive into market insights with our colleagues from NMG, to see how we stack up in the industry and where we can pull ahead of the competition. 
After that, it’s breakout time – you’ll be rotating through four focused breakout sessions on our segment’s top priorities. 
After lunch, we’ll continue those rotations so everyone gets to engage in each topic. 
Finally, we’ll regroup for closing remarks and hear CEO reflections from Naveed Irshad to cap off the day. 
So buckle up - it’s going to be an insightful day 

Alright, let’s get started with our first session of the day. It’s my pleasure to welcome Ash Desai, our Head of Group Benefits, who will be facilitating a special fireside chat with a very special guest, Domenic Pilla
Ash deep expertise in Group Benefits and his perspective on how health and leadership intersect with strategy. His experience will help us connect Domenic’s insights to our own journey as we aim to become Canadians’ trusted health partner. 
Domenic is a highly respected Canadian business leader with over 30 years of experience across healthcare, retail, and energy. From 2017 to 2021, he served as President & CEO of McKesson Canada, where he unified independent divisions into a single platform and implemented a shared services model to drive significant cost efficiencies. Previously, as President & CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart (2011–2016), he led a major strategic repositioning and led the $13 billion sale-merger to Loblaw, creating a market-leading value proposition for Canadian consumers. Today, Domenic continues to shape the industry as a Director at Carebook Advisor Board and through his work on several boards. Please join me in welcoming Ashesh and Domenic to the stage. 

Wow, thank you Ash and Domenic, for that insightful discussion. Let’s give them another big round of applause!
 
Alright, folks, now it’s time for a quick break. We’ll reconvene at 10:50 am. But before you disappear in search of coffee, let me explain what happens after the break, because it’s a bit different from a typical conference.
When we return, we’ll be kicking off our breakout rotations. You’re going to rotate through four different breakout sessions, each in a different room, each focusing on one of our segment’s key strategic priorities. Think of it like an interactive circuit training for your brain – minus the jumping jacks. The four breakout topics are: 1) AI, 2) Unified Customer Experience, 3) Unified Advisor Experience & Distribution, and 4) Health.
Why are we doing rotations? The purpose is to create space for focused, small-group discussions. This way, everyone gets a chance to dive deeper into each priority area, ask your questions, and engage in candid conversations with the leaders and experts driving those initiatives. It’s not just presentations - it’s a dialogue. By the end of the day, you will have rotated through all four topics, which is pretty awesome.
